This folder contains all models for a local GPT4All (backend) instance you can run with this application by calling the python program `gpt4all.py` in the gpt-connection folder.
If the wanted model is not in this folder, it will be downloaded.

Or you can download the models by yourself. The files must end with 'Q4_0.gguf'.
The name of the model is the filename without the ending.
